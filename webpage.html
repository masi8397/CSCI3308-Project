  		<p>We have a media file organizer and online server using a Raspberry Pi. Media files (images, sound files, or videos) 
can be placed in file storage and are organized into a searchable database.<br/>The server can be accessed locally
 or remotely through a browser-based GUI interface which can search through the files and play them in the browser.</p>
